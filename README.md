01 HTML,CSS and GIT: Code Refactor


##This is a code refactor challenge for a marketing agency, Horiseon.

This project focuses on refactoring existing code to improve readability, maintainability, performance and for search engine purpose. The primary goal is to enhance the overall structure of the codebase while preserving its functionality.


## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



## Changes made
* I switched the non-semantic elements to semnatic elements by swapping the elements <div> to elements like <section>, <aside>, <footer>, <article>.

* I made sure the elements in the code base follows a logical structure which makes it independent of styling and positioning.

* I added the (alt="") attribute to each image as an alternate in the case where image cannot load or for people who needs accessibility options.

* i made sure my heading follows sequential order in the order of H1 to H6

* I ensured to add a concise, descriptive title
